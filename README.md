# BrandNavigator üöÄ

BrandNavigator is an AI-powered web application designed to help founders and entrepreneurs research, evaluate, and select effective brand names for their ventures. It leverages multiple AI agents to streamline the complex branding process.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Planned)

*   **AI Orchestrator:** Guides users through the naming workflow.
*   **Market Research Agent:** Scans the web, social media, and basic trademark databases for name usage and availability.
*   **Brand Evaluator Agent:** Analyzes names based on linguistic characteristics, relevance, and potential connotations.
*   **Report Generator Agent:** Consolidates findings into clear, comparable reports.
*   **QA Agent:** Answers user questions about the tool and branding concepts.
*   **Project-Based Workflow:** Organize research around specific business ideas or projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Tentative)

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django - TBD)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Vue/HTMX - TBD)
*   **AI:** Various Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Claude), potentially specialized APIs/models.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite (TBD)
*   **Deployment:** Cloud Platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP - TBD)

## üèÅ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git
*   Access to required AI model APIs (e.g., OpenAI API Key)
*   (Optional) Node.js/npm if using a JavaScript framework for the frontend.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/BrandNavigator.git
    cd BrandNavigator
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Edit the `.env` file and add your actual API keys and configuration values (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`).
        ```dotenv
        # .env
        FLASK_APP=brand_navigator.app # Or your main app entry point
        FLASK_ENV=development
        SECRET_KEY='a_very_secret_key_for_dev' # Change for production!

        # --- API Keys ---
        OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE'
        # Add other necessary API keys (e.g., search engine APIs)

        # --- Database ---
        DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///brandnavigator.db' # Example for SQLite
        # DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:password@host:port/database' # Example for PostgreSQL

        # Add other configuration as needed...
        ```
    *   **Important:** Ensure the `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

5.  **Database Setup (if applicable):**
    *   If using a database like PostgreSQL and an ORM (like SQLAlchemy with Flask-Migrate):
        ```bash
        # Example commands (may vary based on setup)
        flask db init  # Run only once to initialize migrations
        flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
        flask db upgrade
        ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    # Example using Flask
    flask run
    ```
    The application should now be running locally (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
